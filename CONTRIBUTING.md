# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Follow this guide to get started.

## üì• Repository Setup

It's relatively easy to set this repository up. You simply clone it into a folder of your choice and you're good to go! We recommend cloning the `master` branch. It's also recommended to use the Rojo VSCode extension, but it is not necessary. In fact, you can use any editor you want.

## üß™ Running & Testing

This project is built around Rojo-based development. To run it:

1. Use [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) to sync the project into Roblox Studio
2. Open a test place inside Studio
3. Run the game and check the output for logs, warnings, or errors.

## üß† Contributing Guidelines

-   **Open an issue before making large changes**

    If you're planning to add a new feature or major refactor, open a GitHub Issue first so we can discuss the direction.

-   **Keep PRs focused**

    Smaller, focused pull requests are easier to review and merge.

-   **Follow existing conventions**

    Match the current code style. This includes:

    -   Consistent indention
    -   Avoid unnecessary abstraction
    -   Use **StyLua** for consistent formatting

-   **Document your additions**

    Mention in the PR if the documentation needs a change aswell.

## üêû Bug Reports & Feature Requests

-   Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request new features.
-   Include steps to reproduce bugs if possible.
-   You can also link to a repro place file or Rojo project.

## ü§ù Feedback & Questions

Have an idea but not sure if it fits? Open a discussion or issue - collaboration is welcome.
