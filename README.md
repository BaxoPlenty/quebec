# Quebec - a modular Roblox game framework

> \*\*This file will be rewritten when Quebec v4.0.0 is released.

## 👾 Rojo Version

This project was built using the [crates.io](https://crates.io/) version of [Rojo 7](https://rojo.space/).

## 📚 Documentation

The documentation can be found here: https://baxoplenty.gitbook.io/quebec-docs

## 🧪 Example Setup

You can find an example setup using Rojo here: https://github.com/BaxoPlenty/quebec-rojo-setup

It contains 2 branches:

-   `multiplace` - for games having multiple places and shared code
-   `singleplace` - for games that only have one place

## 📦 Modules

Modules are essentially libraries which you can use inside your singletons as a dependency. There's guides for:

-   [Adding modules to a singleton](https://baxoplenty.gitbook.io/quebec-docs/modules/requiring-modules)
-   [A list of built-in modules](https://baxoplenty.gitbook.io/quebec-docs/built-in-modules)
